# python-calculator
calculators coded in python
and yes thes are both made by me

this is just a calculator source(both of them), like there JUST calculators
what i mean by that: it closes right after you enter the numbers and sign,
it doesnt have anything but the calculator script so its kinda useless. kinda
just so yall know 'TEST' is ust really messy and pretty unnessesary and 'calculator' is a little less messy
but they still do the same thing. these calculators are for: plus, times and for dividing math questions
and can do equasions like = '1.5 + 5.3' just make sure you dont use a comma instead use a dot i just dont feel like making it a comma
(dots be built in so yeah why not right?)

i just put it here for the people that dont want to look up how to make one so yeh
dont hate on it bc yeh i dont want it bc hate uhh... is annoying so yeh
the code you can get either from releases or just in the repository itselfe "calculator" if your dumb
dont even know why your reading this but yeah i guess you are now so keep reading nah jk
i tried to cynda explain what everything does so you might kinda understand what sum stuff means but if you dont then that aint my problem
because the calc works(hopefully it should atleast) so thats all what matters right?

the code is very simple and doesnt take long so thats ig why i made it prob not but yeah
im just bored so yeah if yu want it take it if you dont then dont take it really dont care that much
i also kinda made it just bc im learning(i might learn a diff one well i already kinda am) and im just doing this to test stuff so yeah
and yeah also bc python is pretty easy and im bored if i didnt say that yet

the calculators do the exact same but the code is just a lil different
but they both work the same so dont worry about that
now this is not a full thing bc you ca just go on your browser and search: 'calculator' and you will find a working one
sometimes built-in this is just for if you idk actually but yeah

so yeh thats this i guess dont know why you read this but you did i guess
if you want to start programming then dont look here bc i cant either

                        Anyways GoodBye

# python-calculator
calculator code in python

this is just a calculator source(both of them), like JUST A calculator
what i mean by that: it closes right after you enter the numbers and sign,
it doesnt have anything but the calculator script so its cynda useless.

i just put it here for the people that dont want to look up how to make one so yeh
dont hate on it bc yeh i dont want it bc hate uhh... is annoying so yeh
the code you can get either from releases or just in the repository itselfe "calculator" if your dumb
dont even know why your reading this but yeah i guess you are now so keep reading nah jk
i tried to cynda explain what everything does so you might kinda understand what sum stuff means but if you dont then that aint my problem
because the calc works(hopefully it should atleast) so thats all what matters right?

the code is very simple and doesnt take long so thats ig why i made it prob not but yeah
im just bored so yeah if yu want it take it if you dont then dont take it really dont care that much
i also kinda made it just bc im learning(i might learn a diff one well i already kinda am) and im just doing this to test stuff so yeah
and yeah also bc python is pretty easy and im bored if i didnt say that yet


so yeh thats this i guess dont know why you read this but you did i guess
if you want to start programming then dont look here bc i cant either

                     Anyways GoodBye
